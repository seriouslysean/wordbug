            "text": "In this respect <em>laughable</em> is the generic word, but it is also one of the strongest. <em>Funny</em> is the weakest of the list, ranging from the meaning of ‘amusing’ or ‘odd’ down to its colloquial use in the sense of ‘strange.’ <em>Comical</em> still retains a faint suggestion of its origin in connection with the drama, being primarily used in connection with something done or seen, and hence something viewed by the mind: a <em>comical</em> predicament is just such as would be fit for exhibition in a comedy. <em>Droll</em> especially implies the odd or unfamiliar: as, a <em>droll</em> story, idea, fellow. <em>Ludicrous</em> is an advance in strength upon <em>comical</em>, as <em>comical</em> is an advance upon <em>funny. Ridiculous</em> is the only word in the list that throws contempt or even discredit upon the person concerned: it is allowable to tell a <em>ludicrous</em> story about one's friend, but not a story that makes him appear <em>ridiculous.</em> A thing may be <em>ludicrous</em>, etc., on account of its unreasonableness or violation of common sense; if it is <em>ridiculous</em>, it is certainly on that account. That is <em>laughable</em> which simply provokes a hearty laugh.",
